# LightsOut
 A Logic Game Where You Have to Turn All Lights Off
 
- Flip each light on or off by clicking them
- Each time you flip a light, its vertically and horizontally adjacent lights will also flip their state (on or off).
- Turn all lights to win the game!

1) Solver function and button still needs to be implemented
2) Style changes might happen to make it look better
